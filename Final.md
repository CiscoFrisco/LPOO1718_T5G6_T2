## Major Difficulties

Since this was our first time working with Android and libgdx, we had a touch time learning
how to use it and its tools. The first big issue was setting up the git repository, since
there were some files that should be local (like local.properties), and due to that, we couldn't
test the application in both computers. That was quickly fixed though.
Then, we had to learn how to use Android Studio since we used Eclipse previously.
Finally, the big issue came with libgdx. In our opinion it wasn't easy learning it, and often times
we had to rely on external tutorials to solve our problems.
The major issues were learning how to use world and screen coordinates, how to use touchDragged
in order to move the handles and impact the puck, and how to setup different difficulties for
the bot, since we tried to make it as 'human' as possible.

## Lessons Learned

Despite being a tiresome task, with this project we gained a better understanding of how to develop
a game with a user interface and involving physics.
Also it was our first time using design patterns and other refactoring methods, so it gaves a good idea of its importance.

## Overall time spent developing

Before the end of the classes, we had to focus on other projects, since their delivery point were earlier, so in average, we spent 2/3 hours per day on this game.
However, on the final week, we shift our full focus towards this project, so we can safely say that 
we worked around 8/9 hours per day.

## Work distribution

Ignoring some discrepancies, the work distribution was basically 50/50. Most of the time we tried to
work together (at FEUP for example), and when we couldn't, we decided what each of us would do.

## Sources

As explained above, we had to follow some external tutorials in order to complete some tasks. They are the following:
