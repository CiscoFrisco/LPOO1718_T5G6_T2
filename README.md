### Main functionalities
The GUI can be divided in two parts, in and off game.
Off game state is represented by the menu's, which may include the following:

- Main Menu
  - New Game
    - SinglePlayer
    - MultiPlayer
  - Settings
    - Sound
  - About
  
In game, the user will have access to the current score, and a pause option (only in singleplayer mode, in multiplayer this feature may be added but requires both users to press the button in order for it to work) that may allow the user to forfeit, or change the game's options, such like puck speed or bounciness.
